There are various methods that hackers employ to infiltrate Android systems or exploit common vulnerabilities. The most prevalent method is phishing. In the initial stages, an attacker pretends to be an authentic and recognized service or product to manipulate the victim. Once the victim opens and executes the tempting service, it operates as directed by the attacker, providing the attacker with the access they seek.

We've listed some common keywords that attackers use to deceive victims before executing the payload:

- Event wishing (Camera & IP)
- Fake Bank Link (Credentials, Account Information, OTP)
- Lottery spinner (Adware)
- User Interest Related Content Link (APK download -> Factory Reset, SMS spy, Gallery spy, clipboard hijacking)
- Fake selfie camera (Location, Camera & IP)
- Live YouTube Link (Camera & IP)
- Meeting Link (Location, Camera & IP)
- Fake Unlocked APK (APK download -> Adware)
- System Update APK (APK download -> Factory Reset, SMS spy, Gallery spy, clipboard hijacking)
- And more

These are recent commonly used application packages that are easily accessible, even to someone who has just begun searching "how to hack Android?":

- Smseye app.apk
- xphantom apk
- HXPDucky.apk
- Helloboy.apk
- System Update.apk
- Gallery eye.apk
- Location eye.apk

Since these applications conceal themselves from the user, it is challenging to determine whether an Android device has been compromised. A hacked Android device behaves similarly to a normal, older Android mobile. However, there are some signs you may notice when a malicious application is installed on an Android device:

- Pop-ups
- Unknown SMS or calls
- High data usage
- Excessive battery drain
- Overheating
- Reduced performance
- Unusual website behavior
- Unrecognized apps

If you find yourself in such a situation, we recommend taking the following steps immediately to protect yourself from exploitation:

- Delete unrecognized apps
- Run anti-malware software
- Perform a system restore
- Reset passwords
- Inform your contacts
- Notify your service provider
- Report the incident to local law enforcement
